## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly using GitHub's security advisory system.

### How to Report

2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with:
   - A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- We will work to address the issue as quickly as possible
- We will keep you informed of our progress
- Once resolved, we may publish a security advisory (with your permission)

### Disclosure Policy

We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to resolve it. This helps protect users while we work on a fix.
